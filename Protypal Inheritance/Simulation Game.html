// Task : Imagine you are developing a simulation game that involves various kinds of vehicles. Using the concepts of inheritance, prototype chains, and object-oriented design patterns learned in class.
// _________________________

// Create a basic Vehicle constructor function that initializes properties like brand, model, speed, and fuelType.
function Vehicle(brand,model,speed,fuelType){
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
    this.speed = speed;
    this.fuelType = fuelType;
}
// Using the prototype, add common methods to the Vehicle object like accelerate(), brake(), and refuel().
Vehicle.prototype.accelerate=function(amount){
    // accelerate() should increase the speed of the vehicle.
    this.speed+= amount
}
Vehicle.prototype.brake=function(amount){
    // brake() should decrease the speed.
this.speed -= amount
}
Vehicle.prototype.refuel=function(){
    // refuel() should log a message indicating the vehicle is refueling.
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} is refueling.`);
}
// Now, create a Car constructor function. The Car function should inherit properties and methods from the Vehicle object.
//  Additionally, Car should have an extra property numberOfWheels 
function Car(brand, model, speed, fuelType, numberOfWheels) {
    Vehicle.call(this, brand, model, speed, fuelType);
    this.numberOfWheels = numberOfWheels;
}
// Inherit from the Vehicle prototype
Car.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);


// and a method honk() that logs a honking sound.
Car.prototype.honk = function () {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} is honking.`);
};

// Similarly, create an Airplane constructor function that inherits from Vehicle. It should have properties numberOfEngines and hasLandingGear and a method takeOff() that logs a message indicating the airplane is taking off.
function Airplane(brand, model, speed, fuelType, numberOfEngines, hasLandingGear) {
  Vehicle.call(this, brand, model, speed, fuelType);
  this.numberOfEngines = numberOfEngines;
  this.hasLandingGear = hasLandingGear;
}

// Inherit from the Vehicle prototype
Airplane.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);

Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} is taking off.`);
};


// Show how you would create a new instance of Car and Airplane, and demonstrate invoking their methods, ensuring that both types of vehicles can still accelerate, brake, and refuel through their prototype chain. 
const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 60, "Gasoline", 4);
const myAirplane = new Airplane("Boeing", "747", 600, "Jet Fuel", 4, true);


// invoking their methodsinvok method
myCar.accelerate(20);
myCar.honk();
myCar.brake(10);
myCar.refuel();

myAirplane.accelerate(100);
myAirplane.takeOff();
myAirplane.brake(50);
myAirplane.refuel();
